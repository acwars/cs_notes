\section{Past simple (I did)}
\label{Past simple (I did)}
\textbf{lived/started/wrote/was/died} are all \textit{past simple}
In questions and negative sentences we use \textbf{did/didn't} + infinitive (\textbf{enjoy/see/go} etc.)

Sometimes \textbf{do} is the main verb in the sentence (did you \textbf{do}?, I didn't \textbf{do})
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\square$] What \textbf{did} you \textbf{do} at the weekend? (\textit{not} What did you at the weekend?)
    \item[$\square$] I \textbf{didn't do} anything. (\textit{not} I didn't anything)
\end{itemize}
The past of \textbf{be} (\textbf{am/is/are}) is \textbf{was/were}
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{ | l l | }
 \hline
 I/he/she/it      & \textbf{was/wasn't} \\
 \hline
 we/you/they      & \textbf{were/weren't} \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
In questions sentences
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{ | l l | }
 \hline
 \textbf{was}       & I/he/she/it? \\
 \hline
 \textbf{were}      & we/you/they? \\
 \hline

\section{Past continuous (I was doing)}
\label{Past continuous (I was doing)}
\textbf{was/were + -ing} is the past continuous
\begin{flushleft}
\newcommand{\tabincell}[2]{\begin{tabular}{@{}#1@{}}#2\end{tabular}}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | }
 \hline
 \tabincell{c}{he/she/it\\ we/you/they} & \tabincell{l}{\textbf{was}\\ \textbf{were}} & \tabincell{l}{\textbf{playing}\\ \textbf{doing}\\ \textbf{working} etc.} \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
I \textbf{was doing} something = I was in the middle of doing it at a certain time. The action or situation started before this time, but had not finished. \\

\end{tikzpicture}
Compare I \textbf{was doing} (\textit{past continuous}) and I \textbf{did} (\textit{past simple}) \\
I \textbf{was doing} (= in the middle of an action)
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\square$] We were \textbf{walking} home when I met Dan. (in the middle of walking home)
    \item[$\square$] Kate \textbf{was watching} TV when we arrived.
\end{itemize}
I \textbf{did} (= complete action)
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\square$] We \textbf{walked} home after the party last night. (= all the way, completely)
    \item[$\square$] Kate \textbf{watched} TV a lot when she was ill last year.
\end{itemize}
You can say that something \textbf{happened} (past simple) in the middle of something else (past continuous). \\
But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened \textit{after} another. \\
Compare
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\square$] When Karen arrived, we \textbf{were having} dinner. (= we had already started before she arrived)
    \item[$\square$] When Karen arrived, we \textbf{had} dinner. (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)
\end{itemize}

\section{Past perfect (I had done)}
\label{Past perfect (I had done)}
\textbf{had gone} is the \textit{past perfect}

 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
The past perfect (simple) is \textbf{had} + \textit{past participle} (\textbf{gone/seen/finished} etc.). \\
Sometimes we talk about something that happened in the past. \\
Compare \textit{present perfect} (\textbf{have seen} etc.) and \textit{past perfect} (\textbf{had seen} etc.) \\
Present perfect \\

\label{Past perfect continuous (I had been doing)}
\textbf{had been -ing} is the \textit{past perfect continuous}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\square$] It \textbf{wasn't raining} when we went out. The sun \textbf{was shining}. But it \textbf{had been raining}, so the ground was wet.
